# Epidemical Population Simulation based on SIR Model for Educational Purpose
## Objective
To make general epidemic simulation based on epidemiology model i.e. SIR model with a modifier for scenario(s) that the user can introduce to the system. Furthermore, the simulation is present with Sandbox format, which means that users can interact with parameters or certain conditions like they are playing games which can engage users to ask the question “What if I do this?” to make it more appealing.
Our main goal of the interaction is to make a hard topic easier and make it more fun to learn by cooperating the concept of gamification with the epidemiology modeling.
